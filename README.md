This engineering thesis presents the design and implementation of a mini vending machine controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The project integrates mechanical, electronic, and software components, creating a functional prototype intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.

The vending machine enables users to purchase products using RFID cards and an internal credit system, instead of real monetary transactions. The prototype consists of components such as stepper motors (28BYJ-48), an LCD 2004 display, an RFID RC522 reader, buttons, a buzzer, and I²C-based expanders (PCF8574). The housing was designed in Autodesk Fusion and manufactured using 3D printing technology.

The software, developed in C++ within the Arduino IDE, handles RFID-based user authentication, credit balance management, product selection, and dispensing mechanisms controlled by stepper motors. The system was assembled, tested, and successfully verified for its intended functions.

The project achieved its goals by creating a fully operational prototype capable of issuing products, managing user credits, and operating reliably under testing conditions. Future enhancements may include Wi-Fi connectivity, remote database integration, and expanded product capacity. The total project cost was approximately 540 PLN.

This work demonstrates that low-cost embedded systems can effectively support vending automation, serving as a valuable educational tool and a foundation for further development.
